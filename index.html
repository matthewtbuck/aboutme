		<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
			<p>My name is Matt Buck. I'm a third year junior at Coastal Carolina University majoring in Digital Culture and Design.
			Some of my hobbies include bowling (when there isn't a pandemic), playing ping pong, tinkering with technology, playing video games, and cooking.
			I work as a confectioner at a store called Wee-R-Sweetz - I make chocolates and caramels, but my main job at the store is making saltwater taffy. I love my job, and I'm always trying to come up with new flavors I can make.
			As an artist, I draw much of my inspiration from nature, always finding joy in seeing the outside world and what it has to offer.</p>

		<h2>Career Aspirations</h2>
			<p>I know I just called myself an artist, but I really don't consider myself to be much of one realistically. I'm much more interested in the back end of things, seeing how the web works and working with different softwares.
			That being said, I do love to create things. I'm very interested in GIS, and I would really like to get more into, eventually making it a career. I would love to use the techniques I've learned in design and web development
			to be able to make maps and display data in very good looking formats.</p>

		<h2>My Aesthetic</h2>
			<p>My aesthetic generally falls under the category of nature. I love trees, water, even rocks, and I love to go out and take pictures in the woods and on nature trails. I like to work with contrasting warm and cool colors,
			oftentimes using a warm gradient as the background for a cool-colored piece. I'm also a big fan of minimalism, and love seeing monochrome art that uses negative space to make it pop despite having little to no color.</p>
