	<p class="statement">As an artist, I mostly tend to focus on fairly simple, minimalist approaches to artwork. Some may argue that this is because I am not very good at art and thus stick to things that aren't as detailed, and those people would be correct.</p>
	<p class="statement">I mostly draw my inspiration from nature, and many of the things that I photograph, draw, trace, and otherwise create have at least some sort of natural aspect. That being said, much of the work that I have placed into this portfolio 
		fits into one of two categories: Natural or Minimalist - some even fitting into both.</p>
	<p class="statement">I've drawn much of my inspiration from other nature photographers and those who have done natural art, finding a lot of my influence from various pinterest boards on those topics. Other than that, I draw most of my influence from my own experiences,
	whether those influences be nature-related or just something that holds importance to me.</p>
	<p class="statement">For this website, I wanted to use a grid-based system within my gallery in order to keep it looking clean and sophisticated. One sacrifice that I had to make was cutting of parts of my work so that they would all be the same size when I placed them onto my gallery page.
	I tried my best to choose photos and artwork that I could cut effectively without losing their artistic value.</p>
	<p class="statement">Overall, I feel as though as a creator, I draw most of my inspiration from my own eyes. For me to be motivated to work on something, I have to have some relation to it - any random thing to me would be difficult to muster the motivation to work with,
	but if I have more intimate knowledge on something, I find myself sucked into my work.</p>
